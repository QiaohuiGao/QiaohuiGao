### 🧠 Highlighted AI Projects

#### 🏥 [AI Triage & Patient Guide Agent (Harvard Medical School)](https://github.com/QiaohuiGao/ai-triage-agent)
> **LLM-powered clinical triage assistant** that interprets symptom descriptions, reasons through medical logic, and routes patients to the right care.

- Hybrid **RAG + rule-based** triage framework grounded by SNOMED-like ontology  
- **LLM reasoning (Claude / GPT-4o mini)** with confidence-weighted routing and safe response generation  
- <3 s median latency; ≥ 85 % routing accuracy validated on synthetic patient cases  

#### 🧩 [SmartCare Multimodal Troubleshooting Agent](https://github.com/QiaohuiGao/smartcare-agent)
> **Industrial AI assistant** that automates device fault diagnosis and operator training using manuals, SOPs, and multimodal inputs.

- **Hybrid RAG + deterministic state-machine** pipeline bounded by **YAML fault graphs**  
- **Qwen2-72B + Mixtral-8×7B ensemble** for bilingual reasoning with **knowledge-graph retrieval**  
- Multimodal fusion (OCR + ASR + text) → vectorized embeddings (FAISS + bge-m3) for contextual search  
- Flask + LangGraph agent orchestration with **ReAct-style tool calls** and Redis caching  
- CUDA + Docker Swarm deployment achieving ~1.8 s latency and 99.9 % uptime  

#### 📊 [Supplier Management System](https://github.com/QiaohuiGao/supplier-management)
> Full-stack B2B platform for product, order, and inventory management.  
**Java / Spring Boot / MySQL** backend with React dashboards and analytics.

#### 🧍‍♀️ [AI-Based Physical Performance Evaluation Tool](https://github.com/QiaohuiGao/ExploreWorld)
> Flask + React system that estimates human fitness metrics from pose video input and provides **LLM-based personalized training suggestions**.
